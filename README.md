# HiggsBosonChallengeTensorflow

Solution for Higgs Boson Machine Learning Kaggle Challenge using a neural network built with TensorFlow, goal is to recognize if a particle is a background or signal event from a csv file of data from a particle accelerator.

Python program creates a model that produces loss of ~0.054-0.066 and accuracy of ~0.97-0.98 (97-98%) on test data.
